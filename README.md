# Voice-control-vehicle

About project:

This project describes the implementation of a voice-controlled robotic car using 
Arduino. In this project, the user gives specific voice commands to the robot 
through an Android app installed on the smart phone. At the receiving side, a 
Bluetooth transceiver module receives the commands and forwards them to the 
Arduino on the robotic car. 

Arduino controls the movements of the robot according to received commands. The 
robot moves forwards, backwards, left and right, and stops respectively. The 
system consists of a transmitter (Android smart phone) and a receiver 
(robot).Android smart phone with amr voice control app is used to give commands 
to your slave device (robot).
